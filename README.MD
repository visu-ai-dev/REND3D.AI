## Model Architecture

REND3D combines multiple advanced AI technologies:
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Used to generate the geometry of 3D objects.
- **Transformers:** Convert textual inputs into contextual vector representations.
- **Rendering Optimization:** Ensures realistic textures and visual fidelity.

### Workflow
1. **Text Processing:** Input descriptions are analyzed and transformed into contextual representations.
2. **Geometry Generation:** Basic 3D shapes are created.
3. **Texturing:** Textures are applied based on contextual cues.
4. **Optimization:** Final models are fine-tuned for use in engines like Unity and Unreal Engine.

## Training Process

### Dataset
The model is trained on a large dataset comprising:
- Publicly available 3D models.
- Object descriptions and associated metadata.
- Synthetic data for diverse use cases.

### Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Standardizes descriptions and segments models into manageable parts.
2. **Training:** Uses deep learning to map textual descriptions to 3D geometries.
3. **Validation:** Compares generated outputs with real-world models to refine accuracy.
